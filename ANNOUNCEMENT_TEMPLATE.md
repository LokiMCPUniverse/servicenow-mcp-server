**Title:** Introducing ServiceNow MCP Server - Open Source Integration Tool for ServiceNow API

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

I've just released an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for ServiceNow that provides complete API integration for modern development tools.

**What it does:**
- Complete ServiceNow API coverage (Incidents, Changes, Problems, CMDB, Service Catalog, KB)
- Works with any MCP-compatible tool (VS Code, Cursor, various automation frameworks)
- Async Python implementation with robust error handling
- Highly customizable with feature flags
- Production-ready with comprehensive test coverage

**Key Features:**
- Environment-based configuration
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Structured JSON logging
- Support for custom tables
- Comprehensive tool definitions for all major ServiceNow operations

**Use Cases:**
- Automate incident management from your IDE
- Query CMDB directly from development tools
- Create change requests programmatically
- Search knowledge base without leaving your editor
- Build custom automation workflows

**Links:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/asklokesh/servicenow-mcp-server
